#xl.css
####*Sort of like [Medium](https://medium.com/), but not as tight.*

#JULY 2015 UPDATE
Ever since Mayhem stopped working on 4chan X, I guess I gave up on this style. Pretty sure it uses all the old classes so it won't really work with ccd0's version and would require a bit of changing.

I'll leave it here for archive's sake. However, a new version is being worked on.

Honestly, not very usable in its current state.

Again, you're going to have to block the default stylesheets using the method from collabstyle, and then you'll also need `xl.user.js` to add a pinch of rice.

####Stuff You Need

Currently only Firefox is supported, as this userstyle uses CSS variables, which __ARE NOT__ supported officially yet.
